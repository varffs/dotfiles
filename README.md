# .files

Build from https://github.com/myshov/dotfiles/ 18/10/2020

Mostly I just removed things I didn't want or need, and changed the Homebrew package to install.

---

## Package overview

## Install

On a sparkling fresh installation of OS X:

    sudo softwareupdate -i -a
    xcode-select --install

Install the dotfiles with either Git or curl:

### Clone with Git

    git clone https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles.git
    source dotfiles/install.sh

### Remotely install using curl

Alternatively, you can install this into `~/.dotfiles` remotely without Git using curl:

    sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/webpro/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

Or, using wget:

    sh -c "`wget -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpro/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

## The `dotfiles` command

    $ dotfiles help
    Usage: dotfiles <command>
    
    Commands:

## Customize/extend

You can put your custom settings, such as Git credentials in the `system/.custom` file which will be sourced from `.bash_profile` automatically. This file is in `.gitignore`.

Alternatively, you can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at `~/.extra`.

* The runcom `.bash_profile` sources all `~/.extra/runcom/*.sh` files.
* The installer (`install.sh`) will run `~/.extra/install.sh`.
